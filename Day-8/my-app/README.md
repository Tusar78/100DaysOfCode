## Composition vs Inheritance?
Composition is also a familiar concept in Object Oriented Programming. Instead of inheriting properties from a base class, it describes a class that can reference one or more objects of another class as instances.

## About tightly coupled and loosely coupled?
A coupling is a connection or dependency between elements. If changing one element requires changing another element then we say there is tight coupling. If elements are loosely coupled, changing one element does not imply changes in the other.
